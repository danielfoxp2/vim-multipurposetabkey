This plugin deal with the tab key behaviour while in Insert Mode                                                                                  
and it is very simple:                                                                                                                            
* If you are in the begining of a line => do indentation;                                                                                        
* Else => do completion;                                                                                                                         
This plugin was grabbed from .vimrc of Gary Bernhardt,                                                                                            
who is a great inspiration for me.
